## Overview

Call the mock credentials endpoint while logged out and inspect the sensitive response.

This repository is a **sanitized educational case study**. It does not target a real company or live system. The CTF lab is a mock vulnerable app where the flag unlocks only after reproducing the simulated bug.

## Play the CTF Simulation

Run locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

## Safety

Use this project only for learning, local labs, and responsible disclosure practice. Do not test destructive actions, IDORs, token exposure, or business-logic abuse against systems you do not own or have permission to test.
